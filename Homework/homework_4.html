        William Shakespeare (baptised 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright
        and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the greatest
        playwright in the world. He is often called the national poet of England and the "Bard of
        Avon." His surviving works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays, 154
        sonnets, two long narrative poems, and several other poems, some of which are of uncertain
        authorship. His plays have been translated into all major living languages and are performed
        more often than the plays of any other playwright. <br /><br />Shakespeare was born and
        raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway,
        with whom he had three children.: Susanna and the twins Hemnet and Judith. Between 1585 and
        1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and co-owner of a theater
        troupe called The Lord Chamberlain's Servants, later known as The King's Servants. At the
        age of 49 (circa 1613), he apparently retired to Stratford, where he died three years later.
        There are few records of Shakespeare's personal life.; This has generated considerable
        speculation regarding issues such as his appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs,
        and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often
        criticized for not taking into account that there are few records of most commoners from
        that period. Shakespeare created most of his famous works between 1589 and 1613. His early
        plays were mostly comedies and chronicles and are considered some of the best works in these
        genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear
        and Macbeth, all of which are considered to be among the finest works in English. In the
        last period of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romantic plays) and
        collaborated with other playwrights. <br /><br />Many of Shakespeare's plays were published
        during his lifetime in publications of varying quality and accuracy. However, in 1623, two
        fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare, John Hemings and Henry Condell, published a more
        definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collection of Shakespeare's dramatic
        works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was preceded by a poem by Ben
        Jonson, in which Johnson prophetically hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as "not for
        the ages, but for all time." <br /><br />Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries,
        Shakespeare's works were constantly being adapted and rediscovered by new trends in science
        and performing arts. His plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted
        in various cultural and political contexts around the world.<br />
